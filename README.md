# pymab
Python library for Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms



# TODOs
* Check why the thompson sampling is doesn't have amazing results with gaussian distribution (might just be how it works and not an error)
* Test if algorithms are working with bernoulli distribution
* add tests
* make class with optimized initialization, without it beign in Policy since most policies don't use it.
* Complete remaining algorithms
